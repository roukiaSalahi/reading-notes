 ## Flash

Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.

***Note : In order to use this file on a web page it has to be saved in a different format known as SWF. (It has the .swf file extension***
When you export the movie into SWF format, Flash creates code that you can use to embed the Flash movie in your page. Traditionally, this code used the HTML `<object>` and `<embed>` tags. However, now it is more common to use JavaScript. To view Flash, browsers need to use a plugin (an extra piece of software that runs in the browser) called the Flash Player. Statistics commonly indicate that 98% of browsers on desktop computers have the Flash plugin installed. (The percentage of mobiles and tablets with it is much less.)

## Practical information

### search engine optimization (SEO)

At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results.
They consider how many sites link to you (and how relevant those links are).

- on-Page techniques : methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines. (keywords)
  -  Page title 
  -  url / WeB address 
  -  headings
  -  text
  -  link text  
  -  image alt text
  -  Page descriPtions 

- off-Page techniques :  the number of other sites that link to yours. the words between the opening `<a> `tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link

### analytics: learning about your Visitors

As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics. The Google Analytics service relies on you signing up for an account at:` www.google.com/analytics` The site will give you a piece of tracking code which you need to put on every page of your site.

### Where are your Visitors coming from

- referrers 
This shows the sites that have linked to you and the number of people who have come via those sites. If a site sends a lot of traffic to you, get in touch and try to work together to ensure that traffic keeps flowing. You could also try to find similar sites and ask them to link to you. 
- direct
This shows which page a user arrived on if they did not come via a link on another site. They might have typed the URL into their browser, used a browser bookmark, or clicked a link in an email, PDF, or Word document.
- search terms
This shows the terms users entered into a search engine to find your site. This can help you learn how visitors describe what they're looking for (which is often different to how someone might describe their own site). This can help you fine-tune your content and your SEO keywords.

### domain names & hosting

- domain 
is name of your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc. co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name. 
- Web hosting
you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.
